# nini.standard

nini.standard is a port of [nini library](http://nini.sourceforge.net/index.php) to .Net Standard 2.0. I have created it when I was unlucky to get assignment on porting a large legacy project to .Net Core.

# What is nini?

Nini is an uncommonly powerful .NET configuration library designed to help build highly configurable applications quickly.
